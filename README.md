# rusttar

This project is to implement the basic TAR format in Rust as specified by
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html).

To start out, it will only implement the list function of tar.  It will take an already created archive and read the data structures to list all of the files.  Once that is working, I will go back and add in the create and untar functions.
